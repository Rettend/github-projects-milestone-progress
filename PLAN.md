# PLAN

GitHub paginates issues so only 25 issues are loaded per milestone.
Nothing we can do so at least we cache it.

Also the progress bar becomes continous after 10 bar items which looks better than GitHub's progress bar which just stacks bar items until they are so small that they disappear :/
